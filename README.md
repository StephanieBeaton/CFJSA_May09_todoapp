# CFJSA_May09_todoapp
Build a Todo app using HTML, CSS and jQuery. *   Your to-do app should display a list of to-do items as well as add, edit and delete them. Feel free to add to anything you’d like to that application.  Create a simple HTTP server using node. *   This server should respond to a root-url request with a file called index.html. Do not use Express.js. Your code should have error checking and at least one callback. Put five or more html elements in your index.html. One of the elements should be a link to an external page. Things to research: node.js, callbacks, the fs module, the http module.
